# Work

A description for each of these projects is below:

## AnimalSimulation

A JavaScript library that enables developers to create simulations of animals through a simulation builder, resource chart builder, and information display builder. There are also landing and documentation pages linked from the README in the folder.

## ChatSystem

Creates Twitter-like functionality (follower-followee relations, message length limits etc.) and allows users to send messages to other users using a socket implementation.

## FileTree

## InteractiveHeatmaps
