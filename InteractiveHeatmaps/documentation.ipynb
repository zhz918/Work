    "This visualization provides options to control a heatmap of the 307 area displayed over time to answer questions regarding dwell time and object traffic. The heatmap is a 24 by 32 grid of rectangles consisting of square zones with a side length of 20 pixels. The zones are coloured blue with transparency determined by the value of the selected metric in that zone. The function of each option is explained below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Area**: One of the three areas tracked by Numina sensors at 307. The background image will show the chosen area and the heatmap values are displayed for this area.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Object Type**: The type of object to be tracked in the heatmaps. This option is useful for seeing how trends vary between the object types.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Metric**: The interpretation of the heatmap opacities. Each metric is calculated for each of the rectangular zones for the day displayed at the top of the heatmap. Each zone is coloured blue and a less transparent zone indicates the value of the metric in that zone is greater. The metrics are\n",
    " * **Object Count**: The number of objects of the type selected by Object Type passing through the zone.\n",
    " * **Mean Dwell Time**: The mean dwell time of all objects of the type selected by Object Type passing through the zone.\n",
    " * **Cumulative Count**: The total number of objects of the type selected by Object Type passing through the zone from the day the sensors start tracking to the day displayed at the top of the heatmap.\n",
    " * **Absorption Index**: This metric is explained in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weekday**: If a weekday is selected, then the heatmap will only show data for that weekday. Selecting \"All\" will display data for all days. This option is useful for seeing how the trend for a specific weekday compares with the general trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Show Events Only**: If this box is checked, then the heatmap will only cycle through days that are events. If this box is unchecked, then the heatmap will cycle through all days the area was tracked by sensors. This option is useful for comparing trends in non-event days with trends in event days.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Date Slider**: If this box is checked, then the date input is through the date slider controls. If this box is not checked, then the date is inputted in the Date textbox. This slider enables the viewer to see how object counts and dwell time changes over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Date**: This option is enabled only if Use Date Slider is unchecked. The user can enter a date containing a month, day, and year. The heatmap will then display data for that day. If the day lies outside the tracked date range, no data is shown. This option is useful for quickly viewing and comparing data for days of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Date Slider Controls**: The date slider can be moved left or right to determine the date whose data will be shown in the heatmap. The slider can also be controlled using the buttons. The first button will resume playing the visualization if it was paused. The second button with pause the visualization if it was playing. The third button will reset the slider to the start and pause the visualization. The fourth button will automatically restart the slider when the end date is reached and continue playing the visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Show Advanced Options**: If this box is checked, then additional filtering options will be shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Minimum Zone Objects**: The minimum number of objects that must pass through a zone for a colour to be displayed on the zone. The type of object used is the one set by the Object Type selector. This option is useful for filtering out outliers with few people passing through in the heatmap when mean dwell time is the metric. Such zones do not have sufficient samples passing through to get an accurate measure of mean dwell time. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Zones Shown**: The number of zones to be shown. The zones selected to be shown are determined based on Zone Quality. This option is useful to highlight the top zones and to see if they tend to be clustered.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Zone Quality**: The selection method to determine the zones that are displayed when Zones Shown is set. This option is useful for highlighting the extremes of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Display Mode**: If \"Relative\" is selected, then the transparency of a zone is determined by comparing the value of that zone with the value of the zone having the highest value. If \"Absolute\" is selected, then the value of the zone is compared with a fixed number entered in Maximum Zone Value. Using \"Relative\" is helpful for comparing zones in a single day while \"Absolute\" enables a more accurate view of the numerical value of a zone.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Maximum Zone Value**: Can be used only when \"Absolute\" is selected for Display Mode. Zones with values at least this parameter are all coloured with the least possible transparency."

    "### Absorption Index\n",
    "\n",
    "The metric selector in the dwell time heatmap has an absorption index option which is explained below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The absorption index of a zone answers the following question:\n",
    "\n",
    ">_What is the probability that an object passes through the zone given that the object has the opportunity to pass through it?_\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose $Z$ is a zone with zones adjacent to each of the left, top, right, or bottom edge of $Z$, which will be denoted by $Z_{1}, Z_{2}, Z_{3}$, and $Z_{4}$, We will define \"opportunity to pass through\" $Z$ to mean the current zone the object is in is $Z_{1}, Z_{2}, Z_{3}$, or $Z_{4}$. The answer to the question is then\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\text{probability that the object passes through } Z  \\text{ given the object is currently in one of } Z_{1}, Z_{2}, Z_{3}, \\text{ or, } Z_{4}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if an object passes through $Z$, then the zone the object passed through before $Z$ must have been one of $Z_{1}, Z_{2}, Z_{3}$, or $Z_{4}$. Thus, the number of times an object has passed through $Z$ and immediately after one of $Z_{1}, Z_{2}, Z_{3}$, or $Z_{4}$ is equal to the number of objects that passed through $Z$. If $N, N_{1}, N_{2}, N_{3}$, and $N_{4}$ are the number of objects that pass through $Z, Z_{1}, Z_{2}, Z_{3}$, and $Z_{4}$ respectively, then the probability can be written as\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "&\\hspace{0.5cm}\\dfrac{\\text{number of times an object passes through } Z \\text{ immediately after passing through one of } Z_{1}, Z_{2}, Z_{3}, \\text{ or, } Z_{4}}{\\text{number of times an object passes through one of } Z_{1}, Z_{2}, Z_{3}, \\text{ or, } Z_{4}}\\\\\n",
    "&= \\dfrac{\\text{number of times an object passes through } Z}{\\text{number of times an object passes through one of } Z_{1}, Z_{2}, Z_{3}, \\text{ or, } Z_{4}}\\\\\n",
    "&= \\dfrac{N}{N_{1} + N_{2} + N_{3} + N_{4}}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "which we define to be the $\\textbf{absorption index}$ of $Z$ and is always between $0$ and $1$, with a greater value indicating an object is more likely to enter $Z$ if given the opportunity to do so. This index applies only if zones $Z_{1}, Z_{2}, Z_{3}$, and $Z_{4}$ all exist, which is not the case if $Z$ borders the perimeter of the area. In this case, the absorption index of $Z$ is not defined and is set to $0$ in the heatmap.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this index, one can determine the properties of a zone that cause it to be more likely to be passed through. These properties can be based on objects present near the zone, location of the zone in the area, and purpose of the zone."
